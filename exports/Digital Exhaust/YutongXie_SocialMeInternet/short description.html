<p>#social&me@internet is an online journal presenting my thoughts on social media and the exhaustion of a digital self. The aesthetics of the website are part of the presentation. The use of popular symbols and digital styling is intentional.. This virtual space can be a provocative expose for one to read into the complex of digital communication, western individualism and the idea of “collective digital selves”. The anchor point of the visual essay is my personal experience of understanding social media and finding balance between social & me.</p>
