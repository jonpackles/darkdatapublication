<p><strong>Bodies, Maps & Cities: </strong></p><p><blockquote>The Implications of the Quantified Self in “Smart” Cities</blockquote></p><p><strong>Introduction</strong></p><p>It might be hard to imagine but there was a time not so long ago when very few mobile phones were in use.  A time where people still communicated via landlines and where people did not know how many steps they had walked at the end of each day. These days are long gone. Digital technology has developed so fast since then, and so too has our reliance on it. All around us, technologies ranging from wearable sensors to hands-free devices have become seamlessly integrated into our lives, changing the way we experience the world. It has revolutionized how we work, how we exercise, and even how we rest. However, although wearable devices - such as smart watches, smart glasses and fitness bands - have largely captured the public’s attention, they’re just the forefront of a much larger story. Urban developers have the potential to integrate personal analytics in urban infrastructure by promoting the use of wearables, analyzing collected data, and making policy decisions based on that data.</p><p>Today, new wearable technologies are currently being developed that connect people to objects, other people, environments and infrastructure, giving rise to the phenomena of "smart cities." These wearables monitor heart rate, temperature, people’s voices, the position of their shoulders, hands and feet and even the chemicals in their blood and bodies. Linking people to private and public infrastructures and the services that run through them is believed to be important for helping authorities anticipate people's needs and respond to them more efficiently. However, this also enables companies and authorities to get their hands on our most intimate data. Despite the fact that personal data collection on this scale may be useful for city planning, what are the implications of having such data in the wrong hands or being applied in unintended ways? What information can be extracted from these data and how can they be used? </p><p>Although not connected to wearables yet, companies such as “Related,”,, the company behind Hudson Yards, already has the infrastructure to track people’s movements, interactions, behaviors and even identities through cameras, sensors and Wi-Fi kiosks distributed in the area. These kiosks aim to relay to advertisers how many people look at an ad, for how long and most importantly, their facial expressions which advertisers claim, relays information about whether people showed interest, happiness or boredom. [3] Also, this company is moving closer to the wearable industry by creating an app for its residents, Related Connect, that aims to replace keys with smartphones. A feature of this app, Pass, a system in the office buildings, scans biometric fingerprints of tenants to allow them into the building. [3] </p><p>However, the implications of such sensors moving closer to and analyzing our bodies - faces and fingerprints - is much deeper than simply having access to certain services or evaluating ads. Such data, when combined with other forms of data that could and will also be collected, can convey information about people’s health, about their innermost states, feelings and eventually their emotions. Such data could be of huge interest to companies who are desperately looking for ways to better understand the desires of city residents.These include real estate companies hoping to understand distribution of emotions and most importantly, for advertising agencies who aim to benefit from quantifying these emotions for branding purposes. This is of huge concern especially when cities, such as New York, are not prepared for these technologies yet and where there are until now, no data-sharing agreement between the city and the real estate companies nor are there any city laws regarding data collection that would apply to real estate companies. These companies are then automatically allowed to infinitely keep this data and use it for whatever purposes they desire.</p><p>In response to the these concerns, I decided to undergo an experiment myself to investigate the social, cultural, economic, and political implications of having a wearable technology that collects people’s intimate biometric data that could potentially lead to interpreting, emotions,innermost states and desires. I was also driven by my own curiosity of what mapping my own biodata would reveal. This experiment is hence, a critical reaction and an exploration to the current desire for technology to quantify our biodata and to the current dominance of bio-tracking technologies, which aim to seamlessly monitor our everyday lives and bodies. </p><p><strong>Methodology</strong>I first identified the variables I wanted to measure based on what information might be of interest to city authorities and companies such as facial expressions for purposes of ads, heart rate for measuring excitement and fear, and distance sensor for possibly traffic. I then designed and built a portable device that would record this personal data that relates closely to the human experience in a city. Through this approach, I hope to explore the relationship between the internal state of the body within a wider urban context. In fact, studies show that there is a correlation between facial expressions, heart rate and emotions [1] [2] and hence, the assumption is that the combination of this data collected could potentially lead to an interpretation of my emotions. Mapping them as points on a map would then allow for the recording of the geographical location of where these emotional changes occur in a city.</p><p><strong>The Experiment</strong><i><u>The Tool (Sensors)</i></u><u></u>I identified the sensors based on Edward T. Hall’s proxemics theory that classifies four main spaces around the human body: the intimate space, the personal space, the social space and the public space. In each of those spaces, I use a sensor that can sense a characteristic of this space. Hence, I collect data from 4 main sensors: a pulse sensor, a muscle sensor, a distance sensor, a GPS sensor and a camera. </p><p><i><u>The Form</i></u>As for the form of this device, I decided to hack a common everyday object to perform my experiment: a hat. By augmenting the hat with the identified sensors, I will hopefully be able to map, articulate and eventually interpret and analyze from this data my own multi-sensory experience in the city.</p><p><img src="cid:Image_0.jpg" /></p><p><img src="cid:Image_1.jpg" /></p><p><i><u>The Path</i></u>As for the path, ideally, walking through the different areas of Manhattan would have been the most accurate approach. However, for the scale of this project, I decided to create a path that I believe would cross through some of the city’s “multiple personalities.” I decided to walk from 34th street - a central transportation hub - through Hudson Yards - “the smart city experiment” - through Chelsea - a bourgeois neighborhood - to finally 16th Street, Greenwich Village. Along this path, I passed through commercial streets, high glass skyscrapers, residential neighborhoods and eventually ended up on another commercial street on 5th Ave and 16th Street. This path is inspired from the work of Charles Montgomery who created, along with scientist Colin Ellard, a city experiment to explore the effect city spaces had on people and found out that people were happier and more friendly in front of “jumbled up messy old blocks” rather than in front of “a pristine new mixed-use block.” [5]</p><p><blockquote>Performing the Experiment</blockquote><img src="cid:Image_2.jpg" /><i><u>The Results </i></u>After collecting the data, I then visualized it using Grasshopper. The result reveals my journey as a visual track on a map: height indicates the my heart rate and my muscle tension at a particular moment and the circles reveal the proximity of people around me at certain moment in time. <img src="cid:Image_3.jpg" /></p><p><img src="cid:Image_4.jpg" /></p><p><strong>My Reflection</strong>After doing this experiment and observing my data, I realized that the personal benefits of such a device could be huge. The device I created is definitely not a perfect piece of technology that accurately measures my biodata, however, this wearable, which was still fairly easy to construct and use, has provided me with an adequate potential to gain a new type of knowledge of myself. By combining my “objective” biometric data, my geographic data and the subjective story in my head as a visual system: a map, I may gain insight into both my body and mind in relation to space in a city. This device could allow me to to make the internal world become external and hence, use it as a vehicle of self-awareness. Looking at this map, I am able to pinpoint locations where I felt my data changes and possibly recount certain events and memories that could have triggered this change along this path. </p><p>Yet, while collecting this data, I couldn’t help but wonder about a very central question: Is this walk I am taking just like any other walk on a spring day’s afternoon? What is the significance of me mapping this walk? Who will use the data I am producing? And if not me, who will interpret this huge amount of emotion data / personal biodata? Will it be interpreted by a software, by people’s reactions or by some other conscious minds? </p><p>To me, the trails drawn of my experience are full of meanings and stories. However, taking a step back from it, I suddenly realized that others would see this representation as a fairly  random trail of points and lines. While I saw an intimate documentation of my journey, I also saw that when this information is collected and stored, there is an inherent risk that it can get into the wrong hands. </p><p>I soon noticed how the vision I have about this tool, as a tool that has the potential to vocalize my intimate internal mental life and public behavior, is probably very different than the desire of advertiser’s and companies to map biometric data and even emotions. Looming over the idea of being able to see what people think and feel is the spectre of social and mind control. Throughout history, the biometric technologies created were used as tools of state control and as tools that rewrite notions of the self. In fact, the mapping of the body is seen as the first step in its governance and in the subjugation of its boundaries to regulation and control. [4] For this reason, real estate agents, car companies, wearable technology firms and most importantly advertising agents have rushed to get into people’s heads to see their innermost feelings and desires. These companies and authorities want to get insight into the geographical distribution of desires, get insight about driver’s stress in cities, about people’s health risks and most importantly, would like to emotionally rebrand whole cities. </p><p>Moreover, another uncomfortable suspicion arises that once introduced, people may not be allowed or actually want to live without these gadgets. It is difficult to imagine why or when and under what circumstances one would yield complete personal transparency to the scrutinizing apparatus of power. However, I believe that this stressful performance of power requires the means to visualize people as transparent vessels of data to be collected. By this, the true test of citizenship then becomes about, not the level of commitment to the state, but rather the degree to which one is prepared to make him or herself known to the state. This offering of personal information to those in power then provides us with a “legal” place in the state and forces us to manifest what the state desires us to be. </p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong>Experiencing how self tracking technology was easy to build, useful to use, and personally insightful. I think that it’s only a matter of time before people start accepting this technology on an even larger scale. With the right technology, mapping our biodata could provide us with the ability to accurately visualize sensations we were not previously aware of. The complexity of combining such experiences of people in a city presents us with a bottom-up process of identifying communal matters of concern and hence, a new approach to city planning and problem solving. However, it is natural to ask and reflect on what the future of such mappings could mean: will it become a method of control? A revolution against authorities? A community consultation service? or even a brain “enhancement” tool? <u>The importance of confidentiality around our personal data cannot be stressed enough.</u> It is only when technology experts, governments, and organizations collaborate to develop comprehensive security and data privacy standards that these technologies could be linked to our city infrastructure. But until then, questioning every device is the best practice.</p><p><strong>References</strong></p><ol><li>Chang, Chuan-Yu, et al. “Emotion Recognition with Consideration of Facial Expression and Physiological Signals.” <i>Emotion Recognition with Consideration of Facial Expression and Physiological Signals - IEEE Conference Publication</i>, ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4925739.</li><li>“Identifying Correlation between Facial Expression and Heart Rate and Skin Conductance with IMotions Biometric Platform.” <i>IMotions</i>, 18 Feb. 2019, imotions.com/publications/identifying-correlation-between-facial-expression-and-heart-rate-and-skin-conductance-with-imotions-biometric-platform/. </li><li>Jeans, David. “Related's Hudson Yards: Smart City or Surveillance City?” <i>The Real Deal New York</i>, The Real Deal New York, therealdeal.com/2019/03/15/hudson-yards-smart-city-or-surveillance-city/.</li><li>Media Collective, Raqs. “Machines Made to Measure: on the Technology of Identity and the Manufacture of Difference.” <i>Emotional Cartography </i>, pp. 10–25, www.emotionalcartography.net/.</li><li>Talks, TEDx. “The Happy City Experiment | Charles Montgomery | TEDxVancouver.” <i>YouTube</i>, YouTube, 24 Dec. 2014, www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiQUzOnA5w.</li></ol><p><i>Karen is a creative technologist, an experience designer and an architect who is currently based in New York City.
